 History

 - 03/14/2021 HPL-AI Public release of Version 2.3a

 Junkang Huang added the parallel GMRES and matrix construction
 part (<https://github.com/schuangs/hpl-ai-with-IR>) for HPL-AI.
 Note that the GMRES did not check the backward-error, which may
 cause the result to be invalid.

 Kan Wu reimplemented HPL-AI with some bug fixes and some minor
 optimizations. The C souce code of hpl-2.3 remained the same,
 while took advantages of modern C++ features such as templates,
 overloading, and backends for GPU via blaspp:
