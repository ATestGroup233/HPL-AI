  HPL-AI Mixed-Precision Benchmark v2.3c  --  April 18, 2021
==============================================================

 History

 - 03/14/2021 HPL-AI Public release of Version 2.3a
 
  (deperated when n > 65536)

 Junkang Huang added the parallel GMRES and matrix construction
 part (<https://github.com/schuangs/hpl-ai-with-IR>) for HPL-AI.
 Note that the GMRES did not check the backward-error, which may
 cause the result to be invalid.

 Kan Wu reimplemented HPL-AI with some bug fixes and some minor
 optimizations. The C souce code of hpl-2.3 remained the same,
 while took advantages of modern C++ features such as templates,
 overloading, and GPU backends via blaspp:
 -- [A] include/hplai*.hh
 -- [A] src/*/HPLAI_*.cc
 -- [A] testing/*/HPLAI_*.cc
 -- [M] configure.ac
 -- [M] src/Makefile.am
 -- [M] testing/Makefile.am

 - 03/24/2021 HPL-AI Public release of Version 2.3b
 
 (deperated when n > 65536)
 
 Kan Wu optimized the device blaspp routines through the
 strategy of buffering memory: the program will check whether
 the buffer size is sufficient at runtime, free and reallocate
 the buffer when necessary. Therefore, it is recommended to
 run the benchmark twice with the same parameters to obtain
 higher computation rate:
 -- [M] src/blas/HPLAI_blas.cc
 -- [M] testing/ptest/HPLAI_pdinfo.cc

 - 04/18/2021 HPL-AI Public release of Version 2.3c

 Kan Wu fixed the bug when n > 65536.
 -- [M] src/pgesv/HPLAI_pdgesv.cc

 Kan Wu added an option to use the half-precision computeType
 in cublasGemmEx (cuda@11: is required):
 -- [M] src/blas/HPLAI_blas.cc

 Kan Wu renamed the executable "xhplai" to "xhpl_ai", to be
 synced to HPL-AI-NVIDIA v1.0.0 in nvidia:hpc-benchmarks:
 -- [M] src/Makefile.am
 -- [M] testing/Makefile.am

 Kan Wu release the software at
 <https://github.com/SYSU-SCC/sysu-scc-spack-repo>:
 -- [M] testing/ptest/HPLAI_pdinfo.cc
